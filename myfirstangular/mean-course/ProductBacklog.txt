TODO:

Integrate with ui so that admin can schedule and make it presentable.

	Admin assign class and time to lecturer
	
	Students can be associated to zero or more classes
	Student submit request to join particular class room and Admin accept or reject
	
	Student allow to join class after lecturer started the session

A classroom must have one teacher and zero or more students (condition apply such as minimum of 5 students must be enrolled etc...)

Lecturer must be associated to zero or more classes

Student given names and account user name are different (account user name and password are used to sign in)



category for classromm creation on admin page with drop down box

Need some organizations for admin decisions for example accepted, rejected etc...



Video Conferencing
* messaging
* join to particular class
* page for teacher to view, join class
* student can raise hand (on, off)


why a first student can't initiate chat message?
Why video from students are not showing up? (Look up some better solution here as well https://github.com/peers/peerjs/issues/808, currently
set time out is used to solve the problem temporarily)
if set time out solution is used for production, might need to use for queue data structure for multiple, near real time new user requests?

*Student
loading all students at front end is not a good idea and not necessary

DO we need to subscribe nested objects?
Drop down box for teacher and also login and authentication

Done

Way to distinguish between teacher and student in video conferencing page (probably teacher flag from backend)?
	Student, Teacher and Admin Sign in
A student request to join a class can't be request again if status is pending (for admin review) or approved.
