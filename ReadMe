##Henry - Instruction
1. Clone project from development branch:
    (Must setup/config Git first)
    For Frontend guys: git clone -b frontend/development  git@github.com:juea01/VirtualClassroom.git
    For Backend guys: git clone -b backend/development  git@github.com:juea01/VirtualClassroom.git
2. Check again which is current branch you are working with:
    - git branch
    - or switch between frontend/backend: 
        git checkout backend/development
        git checkout frontend/development
3. Workflow on Git:
   Master -> frontend/master -> frontend/development
          -> backend/master  -> backend/development
   Rule: Development phase works on development branch, once it completed/tested, code will be merged into master branch.

4. Working with Docker containers:
 - cd: cd /Users/henrypham/VirtualClassroom  (Go to the folder of project that you clone, contains CLIENT and SERVER folders)
 - Build docker: docker-compose build
 - Run docker: docker-compose up
 - Test: Goto browser: http://localhost:3000/
